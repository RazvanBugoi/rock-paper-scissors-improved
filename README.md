# Rock Paper Scissors Browser Game
This is the second project from The Odin Project Foundation's Course.  <br />
You can try it live here: https://razvanbugoi.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-improved/

## Objective
Users should be able to play 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' against the Computer that makes random choice, from their web browser.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome Icons

## The process and outcome
The project started as a game that you could play in the browser's console. There was really no HTML needed at this point or CSS, only JavaScript for the logic part of the game. After the logic was build, HTML, CSS and Font Awesome's Icons were added for a better User Experience.  <br />
At this point, I have learned how to modify DOM through JavaScript to make it dinamyc. Of course, the initial JavaScript code had to be refactor and this made me learn so much. The final code looks so much better in my opinion and I am really pleased with the outcome. <br />
For the entire project, I have used responsive units like EM and flex to make everything mobile friendly.
